Flight Price Prediction End-to-End Project
Now-a-days flight prices are quite unpredictable. The ticket prices change frequently. The price of an airline ticket is affected by a number of factors, such as ﬂight distance, purchasing time, fuel price, etc. Customers are seeking to get the lowest price for their ticket, while airline companies are trying to keep their overall revenue as high as possible. Using technology, it is actually possible to reduce the uncertainty of flight prices. Each carrier has its own proprietary rules and algorithms to set the price accordingly. Recent advance in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) makes it possible to infer such rules and model the price variation.
